        There is usually no formal exam at the end of the course.Participants

        The theory test in the UK consists of two main components:
        multiple-choice questions and a hazard perception test. In the
        multiple-choice section, candidates answer 50 questions related to road
        signs, traffic laws, and safe driving practices, needing a minimum score
        of 43 to pass. The hazard perception test assesses the ability to
        identify potential hazards through a series of video clips, requiring
        candidates to click when they perceive a hazard. A maximum score of 75
        is possible, with a minimum of 44 needed to pass. Both sections must be
        completed successfully, and the total duration of the test is
        approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.
